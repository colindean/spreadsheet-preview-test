# spreadsheet-preview-test

This is a simple test repo to see what spreadsheet formats GitHub can preview.

If one works, GitHub should render a single text cell with two static value cells and a calculation summing the two.
All files were created with LibreOffice v7.2.5.2.

As of October 2023, none of the formats here are previewable in GitHub.
